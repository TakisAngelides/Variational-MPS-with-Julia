# Variational-MPS-with-Julia

Under construction!

Current vesion can: perform the variational ground state MPS algorithm and get the ground state energy and ground state MPS. It can also measure the total spin along a given x,y or z axis.

This repository is for my project at the Cyprus Institute with Dr Stefan Kuhn. The aim is to build MPS Julia code for the variational MPS algorithm that usually
gets the ground state of the input Hamiltonian. Then we will apply it to the 1D transverse/longitudinal Ising model and finally investigate confinement in the presence
of a topological theta term in the Schwinger model.
